# Jak Speedrunning Practice (OpenGOAL)

## Jak 1

| Button combination | Effect | 
|-|-|
| Hold L1+R1+X and press Start or Select | Brings up speedrunner menu for fast resets and access to custom checkpoints. |
| Hold L2 and press dpad Down (or CTRL + C) | Set a custom checkpoint at Jak's current position (also remembers if you are on flutflut or zoomer). Only works if Jak is in an "idle" state. Plays a sound to confirm. |
| Hold L2 and press dpad Up (or CTRL + V) | Reset to last selected skip/trick, or to custom checkpoint, whichever was used most recently. If you also hold R2, for custom checkpoints it will reset the entire game. |
| Hold L2 and press dpad Left | Get on flutflut, or get off flutflut/zoomer if already on. |
| Hold L2 and press dpad Right | Get on zoomer, or get off flutflut/zoomer if already on. |

- If inputs are not working, double check that Speedrunner Mode is enabled under Misc Options
- Known Issues: 
  - if you set a custom checkpoint while Jak is swimming, on respawn the camera likes to go crazy and zoom out until the level deloads
  - Respawning during a cutscene can sometimes crash when the cutscene finishes
  - Custom checkpoints don't perfectly restore the camera zoom
